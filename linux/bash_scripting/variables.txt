When we enclose our content in quotes we are indicating to Bash that the contents should be considered as a single item.
You may use single quotes ( ' ) or double quotes ( " ).

Single quotes will treat every character literally.
Double quotes will allow you to do substitution (that is include variables within the setting of the value).

Command Substitution:
myvar=$( ls /etc | wc -l )

Exporting variable:
export var1
