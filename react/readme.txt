React Apps are SPA(Single Page Applications)
In Multi page Applications multipe pages are sent to the client on request/response cycle
In Single page Applications only a single html page is sent to the server. The next time the user wants
to view another page, another component is rendered in the same html page. This saves the time taken to
get response from server.
