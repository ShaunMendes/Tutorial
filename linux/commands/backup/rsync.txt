command: rsync <options> source <dest>
A fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
Used to sync 2 directories.
It only copies files if missing at destination or modified and source

option:
-r: recursive copy subfolders
-a: copies the files and folders with all permissions and ownerships
--dry-run: shows the files that will be copied
-v: verbose
--delete: deletes files present at dest but not at source
-P: shows progress
-z: compress data while copy

Eg:
rsync source/* dest/ copy all files from source folder to dest
rsync -zaP source/* username@ip:<directory> transfer files to remote server
Note:
the "/" is important to copy all contents of dir and not the dir
